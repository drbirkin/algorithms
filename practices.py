# Number of comparisons in each direction for m queries in linear search

# Given an array containing N distinct elements. There are M queries, each containing an integer X and asking for the index of X in the array. For each query, the task is to perform linear search X from left to right and count the number of comparisons it took to find X and do the same thing right to left. In the end, print the total number of comparisons in both directions among all the queries.

# Search an element in an unsorted array using minimum number of comparisons

# Given an array of n distinct integers and an element x. Search the element x in the array using minimum number of comparisons. Any sort of comparison will contribute 1 to the count of comparisons. For example, the condition used to terminate a loop, will also contribute 1 to the count of comparisons each time it gets executed. Expressions like while (n) {nâ€“;} also contribute to the count of comparisons as value of n is being compared internally so as to decide whether or not to terminate the loop.
